# Kighlighter

Simple and extendable code highlighter in Kotlin Multiplatform with 
a composable output to display the code highlighted on Android and 
Desktop. 

## Usage

```kotlin
Kighlighter(
    snippet = yourCode,
    language = Kotlin(),
    colorScheme = DraculaColorScheme,
    modifier = Modifier.height(300.dp)
)
```

## Customization

### Language

If your language isn't available in the library, you can create your
own language in your project or make a pull request. You just need 
to create a new class which extends `Language` interface and create an 
object for each highlighted code concept.

### ColorScheme

If you want your own theme for the highlighted code, you can create 
a color scheme object with the `ColorScheme` interface to specify
rgb colors for all concept supported by the library.

# Kighlighter

Simple and extendable code highlighter in Kotlin Multiplatform with 
a composable output to display the code highlighted on Android and 
Desktop. 

## Usage

```kotlin
Kighlighter(
    snippet = yourCode,
    language = Kotlin(palette = Palettes.Darcula),
    modifier = Modifier.height(300.dp)
)
```

## Customization

### ColorScheme

If you don't like any palettes provided by the library, you can create
your own palette, the color scheme of the supported language and provide
the palette when you create the language object.

When you create your palette object, add the sealed interface as interface
of your own palette.

When you create your color scheme value class, add the language color scheme 
interface of your own color scheme (e.g. `KotlinColorScheme`).

Finally, you can give your palette in the language class:

```kotlin
Kotlin(palette = YourOwnPalette)
```
